## About the original concepts and data preparations:
My goal from the onset of this project was to provide a clear and simple understanding of the real and urgent benefits of increasing aquaculture farming. While there are positive benefits in terms of food and income, what I most wanted to show were the benefits in terms of what bivalves and seaweed could remove - mainly nitrates, phosphates, and C02 from water. Unfortunately, that data is generally vary inconsistent depending on a great many variables including water temperature, sunlight, level of existing nutrient pollution, etc. For this reason, while there is consistent clear data that this species are beneficial, the info is not so clear cut and simple. Ultimatley, I had to focus just on nitrogen removal and fiscal benefits because that is where the clearest data was available thanks to a recently released study by a group of NOAA scientists and their partners.

I used data provided in the tables of their study to build datasets into a csv. Then I used a simple csv export from NYC Open Data to show how much water we currently use. Thanksfully, the water consumption data was very simple to access thanks to the wonderful open data program.

## My Design Process:
1. Project sketch from a more hopeful stage in the development process:

From that hopeful stage, my design process ended up shrinking towards where the data and my javascript skills allowed. I do hope to had more "oceanic" animations to my designs going forward - including things like making the circles in my nitrogen chart float/bounce like they are in water.

2. Things inspired me during the design development workshop:
